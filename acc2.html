              The product key is located inside the product packaging, on the
              receipt or confirmation page for a digital purchase or in a
              confirmation e-mail that shows you purchased Windows. If you
              purchased a digital copy from Microsoft Store, you can locate your
              product key in your Account under Digital Content.

              You can use the ISO file to create bootable media for installation
              or recovery. You can also install Windows on your current device
              by opening the ISO file, selecting the Setup and following the
              instructions.
            </p>
            <p>
              To create bootable media such as a bootable USB drive or DVD, you
              will need an ISO burning or mounting software. We recommend always
              using a blank USB or blank DVD because contents may be deleted
              when creating a bootable image.

            What's the difference between 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows?
          </h4>

            <p>
              The terms 32-bit and 64-bit refer to the way a computer's
              processor (also called a CPU) handles information. The 64-bit
              version of Windows handles large amounts of random access memory
              (RAM) more effectively than a 32-bit system. Not all devices can
              run the 64-bit versions of Windows.
